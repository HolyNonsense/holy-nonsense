                <h3>Reason #1 - Muhammad was a False Prophet</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the Quran, Muhammad told of the tribes of Gog and Magog, which he said were held at bay by a wall of solid metal built by Dhu al-Qarnayn (Surah 18:92-100) - who is almost certainly the pagan king Alexander the Great, which modern will Muslims attempt to deny, because like nearly every famous historical figure, Muhammad portrays him as Muslim in the Quran, which was definitely not true of Alexander the Great. Muhammad teaches that these tribes will be held at bay until the end times, in which they will rush down and destroy most of civilization (Surah 18:98-100, 21:95-97).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the Hadith, also, Muhammad spoke of Gog and Magog and the miraculous wall holding them back, saying: 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Sahih al-Bukhari 3598</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        "Woe to the Arabs because of evil that has come near. Today a hole has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog as large as this," - pointing with two of his fingers making a circle. 
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    This is also narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari 3346-47, 5293, 7059, 7135-36, and Sahih Muslim 2880a-d, 2881, 2937a. Additionally, there is a narration stating that every day they try to dig through the wall, but Allah repairs the wall each time (Sunan Ibn Majah 4080). 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Muhammad also expands on the details of their final conquest in the Hadith, saying that when they arrive, there will be so many of them that they will be able to drink the entire Lake of Tiberias (Sahih Muslim 2937a, Sunan Ibn Majah 4075), and that Muslims will be able to use their bows, arrows, and shields for firewood for 7 years afterward (Sunan Ibn Majah 4076).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    So, Muhammad claimed that there are vicious, savage tribes existing somewhere on earth, contained behind a wall of solid metal built by a Muslim man thousands of years ago. However, in modern times, the entire earth can be seen with satellites, and there is no wall, and no vast, savage tribes, waiting to destroy all peoples of the earth, each day held back by a miraculous repair to Dhu al-Qarnayn's wall. Therefore, a large part of Muhammad's end times doctrine is centered on tribes and a giant wall which - unlike Muhammad's audience in the 7th century - anyone today can <i>verify</i> do not exist. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, Muhammad had many other failed/false prophecies, such as his prophecy that the world would end within 100 years (Sahih al-Bukhari 116, 564, Sahih Muslim 2538a, 2539), or within the life of a young slave in his presence (Sahih al-Bukhari 6167), or within the lifespan of an Ansari child (Sahih Muslim 2952, 2953a-c). He frequently claimed that the Last Hour was very near (Sahih al-Bukhari 2222, 3448, 4936, 5301, 6503-05, Sahih Muslim 155a, 867a, 2950, 2951b-e). He even was open to a young man named Ibn Sayyad being the Dajjal, which is an end times figure in Islam (Sahih al-Bukhari 3055, Sahih Muslim 169d, 2924a-b, 2925, 2930a-c, 2931), even spying on him (Sahih al-Bukhari 3056-57, Sahih Muslim 169d, 2930a-c, 2931), and causing much trouble for him (Sahih Muslim 2927a-c, 2929).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    So, one can observe what Muhammad taught about the future, and conclude that he was definitely a false prophet, and not someone sent from God. 
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #2 - Muhammad's Revelations Were Very Clearly Not From God</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    A surprising amount of Muhammad's "revelations" are easy to see as things that he himself just wanted to say, placed into the mouth of "God" by him, to serve his own purposes.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    For instance:
                </p>
                <ul class="gen">
                    <li>Muhammad said that God said that <i>only</i> Muhammad gets to have as many wives as he wants - "˹this is˺ exclusively for you (Muhammad), not for the rest of the believers" (Surah 33:50)</li>
                    <li>Muhammad said that God, in his eternal word to mankind, told everyone not to annoy Muhammad by staying too late as his house after dinner (Surah 33:53)</li>
                    <li>Muhammad said that God, in His eternal word to mankind, told everyone not to speak too loudly around the Muhammad, or call to him from outside of his house (Surah 49:1-5)</li>
                    <li>Muhammad said that he received a dream that he was supposed to marry a six year-old girl when he was over fifty years old (Sahih al-Bukhari 7012) - a marriage which he consummated when she was nine years old (Sahih al-Bukhari 3894, 3896, 5133-34, 5158, Sahih Muslim 1422a-d)</li>
                    <li>Muhammad said that God told him that he would be married to the wife of his adopted son Zaid, while they were still married (Surah 33:37-40)</li>
                    <li>Muhammad said that God said that him having intercourse with his slave girl is fine, and that if his wives do not stop behaving badly toward him, he might just divorce them all, and then God would give him better wives (Surah 66:1-5 - the words of Umar, according to Sahih al-Bukhari 402. There are many narrations stating that Umar directly influenced revelations that Muhammad received - Sahih al-Bukhari 146, 1366, 5796, Sahih Muslim 2170d, Sunan Abi Dawud 3670)</li>
                    <li>Muhammad said that God reassured him that he was not insane, repeatedly, in His eternal word to mankind (Surah 7:184, 34:46, 52:29, 68:2, 81:22). For instance - "By the grace of your Lord, you ˹O Prophet˺ are not insane. You will certainly have a never-ending reward. And you are truly ˹a man˺ of outstanding character. Soon you and the pagans will see, which of you is mad" (Surah 68:2-6)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="gen">
                    These aren't revelations from God. These are instances of a self-serving man putting his own thoughts and desires into the mouth of God. 
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #3 - Ad-Hoc Modifications of Muhammad's Teachings</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the Quran, Muhammad declared that some of God's teachings may be replaced with equivalent or better ones later on (Surah 2:106, 16:101). If the Quran were truly God's eternal word to mankind, one would think a provision could simply be given in the original verse (e.g., do so until such-and-such event), rather than a messy process of giving unqualified revelations and later revoking them.  
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    One instance of an "abrogated" revelation would be a rule which dictated that if a woman had breastfed a man a certain number of times, they could not be married to each other. Muhammad first said that it was to be ten times, then changed it to five, then it was removed from the Quran altogether after Muhammad died:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Sahih Muslim 1452a</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that it had been revealed in the Holy Qur'an that ten clear sucklings make the marriage unlawful, then it was abrogated (and substituted) by five sucklings and Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) died, and it was before that time (found) in the Holy Qur'an (and recited by the Muslims).
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    This is also narrated in Sahih Muslim 1452b, and Sunan an-Nasai 3307<!--Sunan Ibn Majah 1944-->. Why would this teaching be modified? And, why would it be removed from the recitation of the Quran? 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Another instance of abrogation relates to a moral judgement - the punishment for adultery. First, the Quran's prescribed punishment for an adulterous woman involves her being placed under house arrest for the rest of her life (Surah 4:15). Then, the punishment of stoning was prescribed, and Muhammad's companion testified that they carried it out, and recited it as part of the Quran (Sahih al-Bukhari 6829-30, Sahih Muslim 1691a, 1691c, etc.). Then, the punishment of being flogged 100 times was given, and this is what is authoritative today (Surah 24:2). Again, why would the punishment ever be changed at all, or "revealed" in a piecemeal way? 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Finally, Muhammad's teaching on Mut'ah marriage (pleasure marriage) also changed over time. First, he allowed the practice: 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Sahih al-Bukhari 4615</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        Narrated Abdullah: <br>
                        We used to participate in the holy wars carried on by the Prophet (ﷺ) and we had no women (wives) with us. So we said (to the Prophet (ﷺ)). "Shall we castrate ourselves?" But the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade us to do that, and thenceforth he allowed us to marry a woman (temporarily) by giving her even a garment, and then he recited: "O you who believe! Do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you." (5:87)
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    So, Muhammad allowed his companions to "temporarily" marry a woman when they complained to him during "holy wars", by giving her something like a garment, and then the marriages would quickly be dissolved thereafter. This is essentially prostitution. Muhammad's endorsement of this practice is also narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari 5075, 5117-18, Sahih Muslim 1404a-c, 1405a-b, and Sunan Ibn Majah 1962. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Later, however, Muhammad went on to ban the practice, on the same day he banned the meat of domestic donkeys (Sahih al-Bukhari 4216, 5115, 5523, 6961, Sahih Muslim 1404b, 1405f, 1406a-l, 1407a-e). Or, according to some, it was allowed for Muhammad's entire life, and then Umar banned it (Sahih Muslim 1249, 1405c-e). Either way, the Sunni narrations are unanimous in stating that Muhammad allowed this practice during the early days of Islam, yet most now regard it as forbidden. But, why would that ever change? 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    These don't read as divine revelations. They read as someone making things up as he goes along, because he is not relaying a message from God, but instead inventing his own teaching and belief system. 
                </p>
