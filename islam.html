                <h3>Reason #1 - Muhammad was a False Prophet</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the Quran, Muhammad told of the tribes of Gog and Magog, which he said were held at bay by a wall of solid metal built by Dhu al-Qarnayn (Surah 18:92-100) - who is almost certainly the pagan king Alexander the Great, which modern will Muslims attempt to deny, because like nearly every famous historical figure, Muhammad portrays him as Muslim in the Quran, which was definitely not true of Alexander the Great. Muhammad teaches that these tribes will be held at bay until the end times, in which they will rush down and destroy most of civilization (Surah 18:98-100, 21:95-97).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the Hadith, also, Muhammad spoke of Gog and Magog and the miraculous wall holding them back, saying: 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Sahih al-Bukhari 3598</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        "Woe to the Arabs because of evil that has come near. Today a hole has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog as large as this," - pointing with two of his fingers making a circle. 
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    This is also narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari 3346-47, 5293, 7059, 7135-36, and Sahih Muslim 2880a-d, 2881, 2937a. Additionally, there is a narration stating that every day they try to dig through the wall, but Allah repairs the wall each time (Sunan Ibn Majah 4080). 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Muhammad also expands on the details of their final conquest in the Hadith, saying that when they arrive, there will be so many of them that they will be able to drink the entire Lake of Tiberias (Sahih Muslim 2937a, Sunan Ibn Majah 4075), and that Muslims will be able to use their bows, arrows, and shields for firewood for 7 years afterward (Sunan Ibn Majah 4076).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    So, Muhammad claimed that there are vicious, savage tribes existing somewhere on earth, contained behind a wall of solid metal built by a Muslim man thousands of years ago. However, in modern times, the entire earth can be seen with satellites, and there is no wall, and no vast, savage tribes, waiting to destroy all peoples of the earth, each day held back by a miraculous repair to Dhu al-Qarnayn's wall. Therefore, a large part of Muhammad's end times doctrine is centered on tribes and a giant wall which - unlike Muhammad's audience in the 7th century - anyone today can <i>verify</i> do not exist. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, Muhammad had many other failed/false prophecies, such as his prophecy that the world would end within 100 years (Sahih al-Bukhari 116, 564, Sahih Muslim 2538a, 2539), or within the life of a young slave in his presence (Sahih al-Bukhari 6167), or within the lifespan of an Ansari child (Sahih Muslim 2952, 2953a-c). He frequently claimed that the Last Hour was very near (Sahih al-Bukhari 2222, 3448, 4936, 5301, 6503-05, Sahih Muslim 155a, 867a, 2950, 2951b-e). He even was open to a young man named Ibn Sayyad being the Dajjal, which is an End Times figure in Islam (Sahih al-Bukhari 3055, Sahih Muslim 169d, 2924a-b, 2925, 2930a-c, 2931), even spying on him (Sahih al-Bukhari 3056-57, Sahih Muslim 169d, 2930a-c, 2931), and causing much trouble for him (Sahih Muslim 2927a-c, 2929).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    So, before touching on Muhammad's many historical mistakes, one can observe what he taught about the future, and conclude that he was definitely a false prophet, and not someone sent from God. 
                </p>
