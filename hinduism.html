                <h3>Reason #1 - The Fundamental Illogicality of Hinduism</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Hinduism in its earliest form teaches a non-dualistic view of the universe, i.e., that there is no distinction between one's own Self (Atman), and the Ultimate Reality (Brahman, God).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The following are a few quotations from the Upanishads which teach this doctrine:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Mandukya Upanishad - Chapter 1</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        1 OM! This Imperishable Word is the whole of this visible universe. Its explanation is as follows: What has become, what is becoming, what will become - verily, all of this is OM. And what is beyond these three states of the world of time - that too, verily, is OM. <br>
                        2 All this, verily, is Brahman. The Self is Brahman. This Self has four quarters.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - Book 1, Chapter 4</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        10 This (Self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew only Itself as, 'I am Brahman'. Therefore It became all. And whoever among the gods knew It also became That; and the same with sages and men. The sage Vamadeva, while realizing this (self) as That, knew, 'I was Manu, and the sun'. And to this day whoever in like manner knows It as, 'I am Brahman', becomes all this entire universe. Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their self. While he who worships another god thinking, 'He is one, and I am another', does not know. He is like an animal to the gods.
                    </p>

                    Additionally, in the Upanishads, it is taught that enlightenment, and escape from the cycle of reincarnation (Samsara), is obtained by meditating on the fact that the Self is Brahman.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    For instance:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Aitareya Upanishad - Chapter 3</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        1 Who is He upon whom we meditate thinking: "This is the Self"? Which one is the Self? Is it He by whom one sees form, by whom one hears sound and by whom one tastes the sweet and the unsweet? <br>
                        2 Is it the heart (intellect) and the mind? It is consciousness, lordship, knowledge, wisdom, retentive power of mind, sense knowledge, steadfastness, though, thoughtfulness, sorrow, memory, concepts, purpose, life, desire, longing: all these are but various names of Consciousness (Prajnanam). <br>
                        3 He is Brahma, He is Indra, He is Prajapati; He is all these gods; He is the five great elements - earth, air, akasa, water, light; He is all these small creatures and the others which are mixed; He is the origin - those born of an egg, of a womb, of sweat and of a sprout; He is horses, cows, human beings, elephants - whatever breathes here, whether moving on legs or flying in the air or unmoving. All this is guided by Consciousness, is supported by Consciousness. The basis of the universe is Consciousness. Consciousness is Brahman (Prajnanam Brahma). <br>
                        4 He, having realized oneness with Pure Consciousness, soared from this world and having obtained all desires in yonder heavenly world, became immortal - yea, became immortal.

                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Katha Upanishad - Book 2, Chapter 2</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        12 There is one Supreme Ruler, the inmost Self of all beings, who makes His one form manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise, who perceive Him within themselves - not to others. <br>
                        13 There is One who is the eternal Reality among non-eternal objects, the one truly conscious Entity among conscious objects and who, though non-dual, fulfils the desires of many. Eternal peace belongs to the wise, who perceive Him within themselves - not to others.

                <p class="gen">
                    The ignorance of the truth that Atman (the Self) is Brahman is called "Maya", or illusion. In classical Hinduism, this is what keeps one locked in the cycle of rebirth.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    However, this entire system is illogical, as if everything is the Ultimate Reality, there would be no reason for Maya to exist at all. Under such a system, the Ultimate Reality would have had to create Maya, and then embody itself in billions of manifestations, locking itself into a cycle of reincarnation in that form, with the goal of ultimately realizing that it is itself once again, and attaining the unity which it began with, which makes no sense whatsoever. It would be a concept of God which has God tormenting itself for no discernable reason. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, proposing that the Ultimate Reality is Atman would mean that there is no distinction whatsoever between Atman and Brahman. But identity (e.g. Atman=Brahman) requires that all essential properties be shared. Therefore, for anything to be Atman/Brahman, it would need to possess all of the essential properties of the Ultimate Reality - for instance, omniscience. Omniscience is not something "optional" for Atman/Brahman, but instead, an essential property. So, if something lacks omniscience - knowing all things which can be known - then that thing is not Atman/Brahman. Therefore, since human beings and other conscious beings lack the properties essential to the Ultimate Reality, they are not the Ultimate Reality. And, if one were to say that these traits are locked behind Maya, or some other restriction, it is of no consequence, because the definition of omnipotence is not "could under some circumstances be all powerful", but is instead, "is all powerful". The same is true of omniscience, and so on. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    After the age of the Upanishads, Hinduism gradually departed from this non-dualistic view, and now is functionally (for most Hindus) dualistic, where God is worshipped devotionally as another entity, as in other monotheistic religions. For most, non-dualism is unnatural, and unintuitive, precisely because when it is scrutinized, it collapses into an incoherent system. Yet, it is the oldest and most authentic view of reality in Hinduism.
