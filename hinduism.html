                <h3>Reason #1 - The Fundamental Illogicality of Hinduism</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Philosophical Hinduism in its earliest form teaches a non-dualistic view of the universe, i.e., that there is no distinction between one's own Self (Atman), and the Ultimate Reality (Brahman, God).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The following are a few quotations from the Upanishads which teach this doctrine:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Mandukya Upanishad - Chapter 1</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        1 OM! This Imperishable Word is the whole of this visible universe. Its explanation is as follows: What has become, what is becoming, what will become - verily, all of this is OM. And what is beyond these three states of the world of time - that too, verily, is OM. <br>
                        2 All this, verily, is Brahman. The Self is Brahman. This Self has four quarters.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - Book 1, Chapter 4</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        10 This (Self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew only Itself as, 'I am Brahman'. Therefore It became all. And whoever among the gods knew It also became That; and the same with sages and men. The sage Vamadeva, while realizing this (self) as That, knew, 'I was Manu, and the sun'. And to this day whoever in like manner knows It as, 'I am Brahman', becomes all this entire universe. Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their self. While he who worships another god thinking, 'He is one, and I am another', does not know. He is like an animal to the gods.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, in the Upanishads, it is taught that enlightenment, and escape from the cycle of reincarnation (Samsara), is obtained by meditating on the fact that the Self is Brahman.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    For instance:

                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Aitareya Upanishad - Chapter 3</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        1 Who is He upon whom we meditate thinking: "This is the Self"? Which one is the Self? Is it He by whom one sees form, by whom one hears sound and by whom one tastes the sweet and the unsweet? <br>
                        2 Is it the heart (intellect) and the mind? It is consciousness, lordship, knowledge, wisdom, retentive power of mind, sense knowledge, steadfastness, though, thoughtfulness, sorrow, memory, concepts, purpose, life, desire, longing: all these are but various names of Consciousness (Prajnanam). <br>
                        3 He is Brahma, He is Indra, He is Prajapati; He is all these gods; He is the five great elements - earth, air, akasa, water, light; He is all these small creatures and the others which are mixed; He is the origin - those born of an egg, of a womb, of sweat and of a sprout; He is horses, cows, human beings, elephants - whatever breathes here, whether moving on legs or flying in the air or unmoving. All this is guided by Consciousness, is supported by Consciousness. The basis of the universe is Consciousness. Consciousness is Brahman (Prajnanam Brahma). <br>
                        4 He, having realized oneness with Pure Consciousness, soared from this world and having obtained all desires in yonder heavenly world, became immortal - yea, became immortal. 
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Katha Upanishad - Book 2, Chapter 2</h6>

                        12 There is one Supreme Ruler, the inmost Self of all beings, who makes His one form manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise, who perceive Him within themselves - not to others. <br>
                        13 There is One who is the eternal Reality among non-eternal objects, the one truly conscious Entity among conscious objects and who, though non-dual, fulfils the desires of many. Eternal peace belongs to the wise, who perceive Him within themselves - not to others.

                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    The ignorance of the truth that Atman (the Self) is Brahman is called "Maya", or illusion. In classical Hinduism, this is what keeps one locked in the cycle of rebirth.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    However, this entire system is illogical, as if everything is the Ultimate Reality, there would be no reason for Maya to exist at all. Under such a system, the Ultimate Reality would have had to create Maya, and then embody itself in billions of manifestations, locking itself into a cycle of reincarnation in that form, with the goal of ultimately realizing that it is itself once again, and attaining the unity which it began with, which makes no sense whatsoever. It would be a concept of God which has God tormenting itself for no discernable reason. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, proposing that the Ultimate Reality is Atman would mean that there is no distinction whatsoever between Atman and Brahman. But identity (e.g. Atman=Brahman) requires that all essential properties be shared. Therefore, for anything to be Atman/Brahman, it would need to possess all of the essential properties of the Ultimate Reality - for instance, omniscience. Omniscience is not something "optional" for Atman/Brahman, but instead, an essential property. So, if something lacks omniscience - if it does not know all that can be known - then that thing is not Atman/Brahman. Therefore, since human beings and other conscious beings lack the properties essential to the Ultimate Reality, they are not the Ultimate Reality. And, if one were to say that these traits are locked behind Maya, or some other restriction, it is of no consequence, because the definition of omnipotence is not "could under some circumstances be all powerful", but is instead, "is all powerful". The same is true of omniscience, and so on. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    After the age of the Upanishads, Hinduism gradually departed from this non-dualistic view, and now is functionally (for most Hindus) dualistic, where God is worshipped devotionally as another entity, as in other monotheistic religions. For most, non-dualism is unnatural, and unintuitive, precisely because when it is scrutinized, it collapses into an incoherent system. Yet, it is the oldest and most authentic view of reality in philosophical Hinduism.
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #2 - The General Tenor of the Vedas</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Samhita portions of the Vedas, at base, are religious manuals of sorts composed by a select priest class in ancient India. They contain very little which would be relevant to a modern person. For instance, the Rig Veda consists mostly of hymns to various gods, some of which remain popular in modern Hinduism, with others being mostly supplanted in favor of a more popular deity like Vishnu or Shiva. The Atharva Veda contains what can be called spells or incantations, including for things like success in gambling. Each Veda functioned as a ritual manual for the priest class which guarded the texts, and would be paid by devotees and those in power for their services.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Vedas were never for everyone to read. Throughout various stages in Hindu history, if a woman, or a member of a certain Caste read or heard them, they would be severely punished. For instance:

                    The above demonstrate the kind of gatekeeping that these texts were subject to since their inception. They are essentially a religious "trade secret" - magic words used by those favored by society to maintain their status in the religion of Brahminism (the religion of the Brahmins/priests). Later, Hinduism became more democratized, philosophical, and devotional. Originally, it was not so. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    These ritual texts, however, were what gave way to works like the Upanishads, the Puranas, and so on, and so they are maintained as foundational by most Hindus. But they do not deserve such a status, and most Hindus do not read them at all. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, it is known from earlier works that in the past, there were various recensions (Shakhas) of each Veda - sometimes numbering in the dozens for a single Veda - most of which are now totally lost, making having confidence in claiming to have the "original text" of any particular Veda functionally impossible. As a digression, it is also known that a large portion of the Brahmanas, which are considered Shruti, are now lost, and the same is true for many individual Upanishads - later Vedic texts.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The oldest layer, therefore, of the religion of Hinduism, can be summarized as a ritual manual for a small, powerful priest class, which is almost entirely unused by modern Hindus, and which has a dubious textual basis which is nowhere near as robust as it was when the ritual manuals were in active use in ancient India. It contains dozens of hymns describing rituals which no one carries out anymore (the Horse Sacrifice, for instance), and thousands of references to a drink whose formulation is now lost, and can only be speculated on (Soma). 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Therefore, the Vedas are a poor foundation for a religion, or a worldview. Their origin as a money-making/power-preserving enterprise by a privileged class in ancient India is relatively easy to ascertain. 
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Hinduism is nonsense because its foundation is rooted in a privileged class of priests in ancient India who utilized people's superstitions to gain wealth and power for themselves. Additionally, the first layer of philosophical Hinduism teaches an incoherent view of reality.
