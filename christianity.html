                <h3>Reason #1 - Jesus was a False Prophet</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus is recorded by the writers of the Gospels to have made at least three predictions of his own coming and establishing a "Kingdom of Heaven" within the lifetimes of his contemporaries in the first century:
                </p>
                <ul class="gen">
                    <li>Matthew 10:23 - Jesus swears to the Apostles that they will not finish evangelizing the cities of Israel until the "Son of Man" comes - a figure from Daniel 7:13-14 who rules the whole world, and who Jesus repeatedly identifies himself with in the Gospels</li>
                    <li>Matthew 16:27-28, Mark 8:38-9:1, Luke 9:26-27 - Jesus, when speaking to his disciples, says that the "Son of Man" will come and judge the whole world, and that "there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom" (Matthew 16:28)</li>
                    <li>Matthew 24:3-34, Mark 13:4-30, Luke 21:7-32 - Jesus, prompted by a question about "the end of the age" (Matthew 24:3), describes a litany of apocalyptic events, and finishes by saying, "Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place" (Matthew 24:34). In Matthew, "this generation" always refers to the generation of people currently listening to Jesus speak (Matthew 11:16, 12:41-42, 12:45, 17:17, 23:36)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="gen">
                    However, Jesus did not return, and certainly did not "come in the glory of His Father with His angels" and "repay every person according to his deeds" (Matthew 16:27). Likewise, the calamitous events that he swore would happen in his generation - such as the sun and moon going dark, all the tribes of the earth mourning at the sight of the Son of Man coming in the clouds, and angels going forth and gathering "the elect" from across the earth (Matthew 24:29-31) - these did not happen either. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Responses from Christians to these failed prophecies almost never deal with all three of the passages discussed above at once. Rather, they are usually isolated, and attempts are made to find a convenient answer to each individually, so that the larger picture is obfuscated - which is that Jesus predicted a very imminent Kingdom of Heaven (Matthew 4:17, 10:7), led by himself, which did not arrive as he predicted, even though the New Testament authors expected it to happen during their lifetimes (Romans 13:11-12, 16:20: 1 Corinthians 7:29, 10:11: Philippians 4:5: 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, Hebrews 9:26, 10:37, James 5:7-8: 1 Peter 4:7 Revelation 1:1, 1:3, 22:6).
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #2 - The Resurrection Narrative is Illogical & Convenient, Because It Did Not Happen</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The most astounding thing about the resurrection narrative is that after rising, Jesus hides himself from almost every single person on earth, then disappears, never to be seen again. He does not stay and teach, he does not write anything, and none of his enemies get the chance to speak to him, or ask any questions.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the narrative, Jesus does not appear publicly to all of Jerusalem, or stay for years and teach - though such things would have banished all reasonable doubt about him forever, and clearly vindicated him as the chosen one of God. Rather, he is said to have appeared to a few followers in an upper room, and then to a scattered collection of others, at other times. Now, all other people for all time must rely on the alleged witness of these choice few, in their very late and contested writings, and <i>that</i> is how the God of the universe is said to vindicate Jesus. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Yet, from the alleged witnesses, we have basically nothing. Most of the Apostles, and those alleged to have seen him, disappear completely from the historical record, leaving behind no writings whatsoever. The only original Apostle to have a text explicitly claiming to be written by them in the New Testament is Peter, and many critical scholars reject that either First or Second Peter were actually written by Peter.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The resurrection narrative probably began as a "spiritual resurrection" narrative (i.e., God raised Jesus's spirit to Himself), and this is what was originally preached by Jesus's remaining followers a few months or years after he was executed. Then, by the time of the Gospels (~40 years after Jesus died), the story was embellished to include an actual physical resurrection, complete with post-resurrection appearances and all - but conveniently, of course, no one gets to see him now - don't ask - and hardly anyone got to see him when it happened before he disappeared.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The story is convenient, because the resurrection never happened. Jesus didn't stay and teach, or do anything sensible - like appearing in public - in the narrative, because it is fictional, and invented by the dismayed followers of a confused man after his untimely execution. 
                </p>
